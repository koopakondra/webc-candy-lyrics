    <p id="verse1" class="verse">
      I was there to <span>witness</span>
      Candice's inner business
      She wants the boys to notice
      Her <span>rainbows</span> and her ponies
      She was educated
      But could not count to ten
      Now she got lots of different horses
      By lots of different <span>men</span>
    </p>

    <p id="prechorus1" class="prechorus">
      And I say liberate your sons and daughters
      The bush is high but in the hole there's water
      You can get some when they give it
      Nothing sacred, but it's a living
    </p>

    <p id="chorus1" class="chorus">
      <b>Hey, </b><b>ho, </b>here she goes
      Either a little too <span>high</span> or a little too <span>low</span>
      Got no self-esteem and vertigo
      'Cause she thinks she's made of <i>candy</i>
      <b>Hey, </b><b>ho, </b>here she goes
      Either a little too <span>loud</span> or a little too <span>close</span>
      Got a hurricane at back of her throat
      She thinks she's made of <i>candy</i>
    </p>

    <p id="verse2" class="verse">
      Ring a ring of <span>roses</span>
      Whoever gets the closest
      She comes and she goes
      As the <span>war of the roses</span>
      Mother was a victim
      Father beat the system
      By moving <span>bricks</span> to Brixton
      And learning how to fix them
    </p>

    <p id="prechorus2" class="prechorus">
      Liberate your sons and daughters
      The bush is high but in the hole there's water
      As you will, she'll be the whole of the law
      And if it don't feel good
      What are you doing it for
      Now tell me
    </p>
